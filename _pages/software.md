The purpose of `Sparklen` package is to provide the `Python` community with 
a complete suite of cutting-edge tools specifically tailored for 
the study of exponential Hawkes processes, with a particular focus 
on high-dimensional framework. It notably features:

  * A efficient cluster-based simulation method for generating events.

  * A highly versatile and flexible framework for performing inference of 
    multivariate Hawkes process.

  * Novel approaches to address the challenge of multiclass 
    classification within the supervised learning framework.
